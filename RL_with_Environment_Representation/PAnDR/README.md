# ICLR 2022 GPL Workshop-Policy Adaptation via Decoupled Policy and Environment Representations (PAnDR)

This is the official implementation of 
our work [PAnDR: Fast Adaptation to New Environments from Offline Experiences via Decoupling Policy and Environment Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02877)
presented at ICLR 2022 Workshop on Generalizable Policy Leanring (GPL).

## Introduction

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been a promising solution to many complex decision-making problems. Nevertheless, the notorious weakness in generalization among environments prevent widespread application of DRL agents in real-world scenarios. 
Although advances have been made recently, most prior works assume sufficient online interaction on training environments, which can be costly in practical cases. 
To this end, we focus on an **offline-training-online-adaptation** setting, in which the agent first learns from offline experiences collected in environments with different dynamics and then performs online policy adaptation in environments with new dynamics. 

In this paper, we propose Policy Adaptation with Decoupled Representations (PAnDR) for fast policy adaptation. 
- In offline training phase, the **environment representation** and **policy representation** are learned through _contrastive learning_ and _policy recovery_, respectively. The representations are further refined by _mutual information optimization_ to make them **more decoupled and complete**. With learned representations, a Policy-Dynamics Value Function (PDVF) (Raileanu et al., 2020) network is trained to approximate the values for different combinations of policies and environments. 
- In online adaptation phase, with the environment context inferred from few experiences collected in new environments, the policy is optimized by gradient ascent with respect to the PDVF.

A conceptual illustration is shown below.

## Example Usage

### (1) Offline Data Collection Phase 


For offline experiences, we first train a PPO policy for each environment. Each of the commands below need to be run for default-ind in [0,...,14] (15 training environments). The obtained policies are training policies that serve as the collectors of offline data. 

For each domain, 50-episode interaction trajectories are collected by each combination of training environment and training policy, e.g., 15 ∗ 15 ∗ 50 episodes of experiences collected in total for Ant-Wind.

#### Ant-wind
```
python ppo/ppo_main.py \
--env-name myant-v0 --default-ind 0 --seed 0 
```

### (2) PAnDR Training & Adaptation Phase

#### Ant-wind
```
# python main_train.py --env-name myant-v0 --op-lr 0.01 --num-t-policy-embed 50 --num-t-env-embed 1 --gd-iter 50 --norm-reward --min-reward -200 --max-reward 1000 --club-lambda 1000 --mi-lambda 1
```
