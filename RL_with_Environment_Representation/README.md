# RL with Environment Representation

Environment Representation is one major category in our taxonomy. 
The core research content of environment representation is to capture the **variations of environments** from the distribution of interests. Such variations can be the inner factors that determine the dynamics, reward functions and other aspects of MDP.

Since these factors are usually inaccessable directly, to achieve the purpose of **generalizing well and staying robust in face of such changing variations**, environment representation is learned to infer the underlying factors from accessible data (e.g., interaction experiences).

## Repo Content

This repo contains representative research works of TJU-RL-Lab on the topic of RL with Environment Representation.

### Context-based Environment Representation and Generalization

As mentioned above, we aim at learning good representations of underlying variations of environments with accessible data.
Obviously, a reasonable type of such data is transition experiences {s,a,r,s'}, also called _context_, collected during the interaction of RL agent in the environment,
since interaction experiences can implicitly reflect the information of environment characteristics, i.e., specific underlying variations. 

We provide a conceptual illustration of Context-based Environment Representation and Generalization below:

The representations of environment are learned by encoding context data and extracting information according to specific context learning objectives.
Afterwards, Context-conditioned RL functions, e.g., ùëÑ(ùë†,ùëé,ùëß), ùúã(‚ãÖ|ùë†,ùëß) are trained, to make the RL agent aware of the environment representation (i.e., variations ideally).
Therefore, with such context-conditioned RL functions, implicit generalization or explicit adaptation among environments can be carried out.
