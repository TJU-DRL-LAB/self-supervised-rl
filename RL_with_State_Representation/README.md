# RL with State Representation

State Representation is one major category in our taxonomy. 
The core research content of state representation is to learn the abstraction/representation of original state space, which is usually high-dimensional, complex and difficult to deal with directly by conventional RL algorithms.
The purpose of state representation learning is to make RL effective, efficient and optimal in especially practical decision-making problems.

In essence, to learn state representation is the process of discovering the decision-related or decision-agnositic (depending on the specific purposes) images of original MDPs.

In our opinion, RL with State Representation contains the research on:
- **What an optimal state representation should be like. (Theories on Abstraction and Generalization)**
- **How to obtain or learn desired state representation in specific cases. (Methods of Learning State Representation)**
- **How to deal with the co-learning and inter-dependence between state representation and RL policy/value functions. (Studies on Learning Dynamics)**
