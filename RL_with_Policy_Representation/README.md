# RL with Policy Representation

Policy Representation is one major category in our taxonomy. 
The core research content of policy representation is to discover or learn **low-dimensional representation for RL policy**, which are beneficial to downstream RL tasks (e.g., policy learning).
In a general view, any decision-making problems which involves multiple policies or a policy optimization process, can be the potential downstream tasks of policy representation.

In our opinion, RL with Policy Representation contains the research on:
- **What an optimal policy representation should be like.**
- **How to obtain or learn desired policy representation in specific cases.**
- **How to make use of policy representation to develop and improve RL in different ways.**

## Repo Content

This repo contains representative research works of TJU-RL-Lab on the topic of RL with Policy Representation.
Currently, we focus on how policy representation can improve policy learning process in a general way.

### Two Types of Generalization

One major characteristic brought by policy representation is **value (more broadly, function) generalization among policies**.

Two general types of generalization is shown below:
- **Global Generalization**: denotes the general cases where values (or other policy-dependent functions) already learned (or known) for some policies can generalize to the values of other policies (i.e., unknown or unseen ones).
- **Local Generalization**: denotes the specific cases where values (or other policy-dependent functions) already learned (or known) for historical (or previous) policies encountered along the **policy improvement path** to the values of the following (or successive) policies we are going to estimate later.

### GPI with PeVFA

An obvious consequence of local generalization is that, we now have additional value generalization for the successive policies during typical Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI).
Taking advantage of this characteristic, we propose a new learning paradigm called **Generalized Policy Iteration with Policy-extended Value Function Approximator (GPI with PeVFA)**.

A comparison between conventional GPI and GPI with PeVFA is illsutrated below:

GPI with PeVFA is general and can be fulfilled by various means in principle. The key points we may have to conisder is:
- Whether the additional generalization is beneficial to or improves conventional RL.
- How to properly represent policies and establish PeVFA to release the best potentials.
