# RL with Action Representation

Action Representation is one major category in our taxonomy. 
The core research content of action representation is to discover or learn **well-behaved representation for actions**, which is significant to RL in _complex action space_.

In this repo, we use _complex action space_ to denote the action spaces which are often seen in practical decision-making problems while not that prevalent in current RL community.

We provide two representative complex action space here:
- **Large Action Space**: In many real-world scenarios, the action space can be very large, often larger than 10^3. For example, advertising of E-commerce, recommendation systems, multiagent systems (joint action space of multiple agents).
- **Sturctured Action Space**: In some other circumstances, the action space is not 'flat', which means an action consists of several components among which the dependencies and orders often exist. For example, discrete-continuous hybrid control in games or product systems.

Therefore, the aim of study on action representation is to find a better representation space which is **favorable to RL** over directly learning with original complex action space.

## Repo Content

This repo contains representative research works of TJU-RL-Lab on the topic of RL with Action Representation.
Currently, we focus on how to learn good action representation which can **boost RL in complex action space**.

### Learning in Latent Action Space

We use the following illustration to demonstrate a general paradigm of RL with Action Representation:

<div align=center><img align="center" src="./../assets/ar_readme_figs/ar_framework.png" alt="action_representation_framework" style="zoom:20%;" /></div>

This illustration is originated from [Chandak et al. (ICML 2019)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/chandak19a.html). 
Given a policy representation space, the illustration depicts the paradigme of latent policy learning, with the help of a _reversible_ action representation space.



## An Overall View of Research Works in This Repo
